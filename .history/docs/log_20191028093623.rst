**Situation**
    First model needs to be built and tested.

**Background**
    The function for measuring the accuracy of the model was created.

**Assessment**
    The logistic regression used a very simple model. Better models
    with the same data may be able to improve the accuracy.  RandomForest
    decision trees may be a better approach as a classification problem.

**Recommendation**
    Try Logistic Regression with age as a feature.

**Situation**
    Completed first model with simple Logistic Regression.  The model
    achieved an accuracy of 80%.

**Background**
    First model did not use age, name, and pclass in the models.

**Assessment**
    Age is known for 80% of the participants. Include age in the model. When
    age is NaN fill with the mean age of all the passengers.

    Logistic Regression with Age did not change the accuracy of the model.

**Recommendation**
    Try Normalizing the features before fitting.
