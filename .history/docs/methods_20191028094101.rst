Data
----

Data can be downloaded from <https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data>_

This data set contains two CSV files: train.csv and test.csv.  When
we train our model we will split the test data into two groups. By
convention the split data will be called train and test. To avoid
confusion with the test.csv data, the test csv data will be renamed
and stored as holdout.csv.

In short, the holdout.csv data is identical to the test.csv data
from the Kaggle Titanic data set.

Variable Notes
--------------

These are copied directly from `Kaggle Titanic Data <https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data>`_

.. |br| raw:: html

    <br />

**pclass**:
    A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
        1st = Upper  |br|
        2nd = Middle |br|
        3rd = Lower  |br|

**age**:
    Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated,
    is it in the form of xx.5

**sibsp**:
    The dataset defines family relations in this way...  |br|
        Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister  |br|
        Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc√©s were ignored)

**parch**:
    The dataset defines family relations in this way... |br|
        Parent = mother, father  |br|
        Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson |br|
        Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.

**ticket**
    ticket has a high cardinality (681 distinct values).  There
    may be useful information in this feature, however, it will
    be ignored in the initial modality.

.. _model-logreg:

Model: Logistic Regression
--------------------------

Simple model using Logistic Regression with the cleanest data. Achieved 80.3% accuracy.

`Model: Logistic Regression <_notebooks/model_logreg__2019-10-17.html>`_


.. _model-logreg_with_age:

Model: Logistic Regression with age 
--------------------------------------------------------

Simple model using Logistic Regression including age in the features.
There as insignificant change in the accuracy compared to the first model (80.4%).

`Model: Logistic Regression with Age <_notebooks/model__logreg_with_age__2019-10-17.html>`_


.. _model-scaled_logreg_with_age:

Model: Scaled Logistic Regression with age
--------------------------------------------------------

Simple model using Logistic Regression including age in the features.
There as insignificant change in the accuracy compared to the first model (81.118%).

Kaggle Results
--------------

I was shocked the first time I looked at the Kaggle Titanic Public
Leader Board. On October 18, 2019 there were 71 entries with a
perfect accuracy score. My first submission I received a 0.77511.

After my shock had worn off and I realized that these perfect
scores were impossible.  I wanted to know what was considered a
good accuracy score for the Titanic Kaggle data set.  There
was an excellent analysis done by `ShapedSundew9 <https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/26284>`_

ShapedSundew9 concluded that a score in the range 83-84% should
be considered good. It looks like I have some work to do. I
reproduced the plots of ShapedSundew9 so I could track my own progress.
