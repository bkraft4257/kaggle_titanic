Variable Notes
--------------

These are copied directly from `Kaggle Titanic Data <https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data>`_

.. |br| raw:: html

    <br />

**pclass**:
    A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
        1st = Upper  |br|
        2nd = Middle |br|
        3rd = Lower  |br|

**age**:
    Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated,
    is it in the form of xx.5

**sibsp**:
    The dataset defines family relations in this way...  |br|
        Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister  |br|
        Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc√©s were ignored)

**parch**:
    The dataset defines family relations in this way... |br|
        Parent = mother, father  |br|
        Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson |br|
        Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.

**ticket**
    ticket has a high cardinality (681 distinct values).  There
    may be useful information in this feature, however, it will
    be ignored in the initial modality.

.. _model-logreg:

Model: Logistic Regression
--------------------------

Simple model using Logistic Regression with the cleanest data. Achieved 80.3% accuracy.

`Model: Logistic Regression <_notebooks/model_logreg__2019-10-17.html>`_


.. _model-logreg_with_age:

Model: Logistic Regression with age 
--------------------------------------------------------

Simple model using Logistic Regression including age in the features.
There as insignificant change in the accuracy compared to the first model (80.4%).

`Model: Logistic Regression with Age <_notebooks/model__logreg_with_age__2019-10-17.html>`_


.. _model-scaled_logreg_with_age:

Model: Scaled Logistic Regression with age
--------------------------------------------------------

Simple model using Logistic Regression including age in the features.
There as insignificant change in the accuracy compared to the first model (81.118%).
