===============

Data can be downloaded from <https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data>_

This data set contains two CSV files: train.csv and test.csv.  When
we train our model we will split the test data into two groups. By 
convention the split data will be called train and test. To avoid
confusion with the test.csv data, the test csv data will be renamed
and stored as holdout.csv.  

In short, the holdout.csv data is identical to the test.csv data
from the Kaggle Titanic data set.
