    `How to Write a Good User Story: with Examples & Templates by Andrew Bondarenko <https://stormotion.io/blog/how-to-write-a-good-user-story-with-examples-templates/>`_

    As a **[type of user]**, I want **[an action]** so that **[a benefit/a value]**

    Great User Stories always fit the **INVEST** set of criteria by `Bill Wake <https://xp123.com/articles/invest-in-good-stories-and-smart-tasks/>`_:

    **Independent** – they can be developed in any sequence and changes to one User Story don’t affect the others.

    **Negotiable** – it’s up for the team to decide how to implement them; there is no rigidly fixed workflow.

    **Valuable** – each User Story delivers a detached unit of value to end users.

    **Estimable** – it’s quite easy to guess how much time the development of a User Story will take.

    **Small** – it should go through the whole cycle (designing, coding, testing) during one sprint.

    **Testable** – there should be clear acceptance criteria to check whether a User Story is implemented appropriately.


Kaggle Titanic User Stories
===========================

* As a user, I want to be able to create a report that predicts whether a person survives the sinking of the Titanic
  so that [a benefit / a value].

* As a user, I want to be able run this report with different models from a command line interface so I can easily
  submit to Kaggle for final evaluation.

* As a user, I want to be able to create a report for a single passenger that tells me whether they survived the
  sinking of the Titanic and why so that I can understand the factors that went into their survival.

* As a developer, I want to verify that the inputs going into the model are similar to the inputs that were used to
  create the model.

* As a developer, I want to be able to save a model to disk so it can be run on future data sets without retraining.

* As a manager, I want to have clean documentation so that I can easily understand what models have been tried by
  the team.
