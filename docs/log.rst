**Situation**
    Completed first model with simple Logistic Regression.  The model
    achieved an accuracy of 80%.

**Background**
    The function for measuring the accuracy of the model was created.

**Assessment**
    The logistic regression used a very simple model. Better models
    with the same data may be able to improve the accuracy.  RandomForest
    decision trees may be a better approach as a classification problem.

**Recommendation**
    Try RandomForest decision trees as a classifier.
